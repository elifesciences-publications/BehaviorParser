This is the library for parsing the behavior data from the Functional Neural Circuit lab in Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

For starter,
>BehaviorParser/DNMS/stats_GLM.m

contains necessary code to parse the raw behavior data to a descriptive number matrix.  

>BehaviorParser/DNMS/plotAllPerf.m

contains necessary code for plot figures using previously parsed number matrix. In the current release some commented-out codes are functional and should be uncommented for generating plots.
